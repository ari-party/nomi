**no** - no\
Â **m** - more\
Â Â Â **i** - invisible (characters)

A zero-config Discord bot to prevent users from bypassing automod (bots).

## Why?

Users can easily bypass Discord's built-in automod system with a single character, such as a [soft hyphen](https://unicode-explorer.com/c/00AD), and there are 21 more characters that can be abused.

![Simple bypass using a soft hyphen](https://github.com/ari-party/nomi/assets/49074962/bb2c44a6-db1f-4548-b479-dfab5111216f)

Nomi offers a straight forward approach to solving this.
It checks if the bot's role is above the highest role of the member who sent a message. If it's above, then it will check the message for these bypassable characters and deletes it if found.

If you wish for Nomi not to reply with these messages (as shown in the image above), simply don't include the send messages permission.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/ari-party/nomi.git` or [download a ZIP](https://github.com/ari-party/nomi/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

2. Make sure the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is installed alongside the latest version of npm.

3. Install the dependencies with `npm install` or `pnpm install` if you are using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (ðŸ˜Ž).

4. Create an application on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and generate a new bot token.

5. Copy or rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and open it with your preferred editor.

6. Paste your bot token after `TOKEN=`.
   (It would look something like `TOKEN=MTI...`)

7. Start the bot with `npm run start` or `pnpm start`.
